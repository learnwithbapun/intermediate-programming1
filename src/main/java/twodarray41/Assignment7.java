 Q6. Q7. Rotate Matrix



Problem Description
You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You need to do this in place.

Note: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.



Problem Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000



Input Format
First argument is a 2D matrix A of integers



Output Format
Return the 2D rotated matrix.



Example Input
Input 1:

 [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
 ]
Input 2:

 [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
 ]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [
    [3, 1],
    [4, 2]
 ]
Output 2:

 [
    [7, 4, 1],
    [8, 5, 2],
    [9, 6, 3]
 ]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 After rotating the matrix by 90 degree:
 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4
 4 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1
Explanation 2:

 After rotating the matrix by 90 degree:
 1 goes to 3, 3 goes to 9
 2 goes to 6, 6 goes to 8
 9 goes to 7, 7 goes to 1
 8 goes to 4, 4 goes to 2
